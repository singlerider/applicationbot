Looking for work?

Just now realizing you're a programmer?

Just now realizing that you can customize a script to do the boring part so you
can study up and improve your skills?

Well, look no further (for now)!

This script will help with anxiety about applying to places with "senior" in the
job description. It makes it so easy that you won't have time for "second
thoughts!"" Who knows? Maybe you'll get the job!
